1. Phase 1 - Discover and Ideation
	1. I have a project idea but need help refining it.
		
		  
		
		MY INITIAL IDEA:
		
		[Describe your rough concept - even if vague]
		
		  
		
		YOUR ROLE:
		
		- Ask me probing questions to clarify the vision
		
		- Help me identify what I actually need vs. want
		
		- Point out things I haven't considered
		
		- Challenge assumptions
		
		- Suggest alternatives I might not know about
		
		  
		
		Ask me clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME (Socratic method) . Help me think through capturing all potential elements of the idea.
1. Phase 2 - Technical Planning
	1. 
		I need help planning the technical implementation of my project.
		
		PROJECT SUMMARY:
		
		[Paste the summary from Phase 1]
		
		  
		
		MY TECHNICAL BACKGROUND:
		
		- Experience level: intermediate technical literacy, small hobby experience with ai-assisted development for websites
		
		- Languages I know: Python, SQL, VBA
		
		- Frameworks I've used: something in javascript
		
		- What I want to learn: whatever makes most sense for ai-assisted development, assuming i will be working with AI for all of the coding
		  
		
		YOUR ROLE:
		
		- Recommend the best tech stack for this project
		
		- Explain trade-offs between options
		
		- Ask about my preferences (hosting, database, etc.)
		
		- Identify technical challenges I should know about
		
		- Suggest tools and libraries
		
		- Create a high-level architecture
		
		  
		
		Ask me clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME (Socratic method)  to understand my constraints and preferences.
		
		Start by asking about my deployment preferences and timeline.
1. Phase 3 - Implementation Specifics
	1. I need help planning and building a technical project. I have Claude Pro and will be 
		working with you in the browser (not using Claude Code or external APIs).
		
		PROJECT CONTEXT:
		[Paste or attach your project summary, requirements, goals, and any technical details]
		
		YOUR ROLE:
		Analyze my project and create THREE complete documents:
		
		1. REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
		   - Complete technical specification
		   - All features prioritized (MVP vs. later phases)
		   - Exact file structure needed
		   - All components/modules required
		   - Content I need to provide
		   - Success criteria and metrics
		   - Design system specifications (if applicable)
		
		1. MANUAL SETUP CHECKLIST
		   - Step-by-step infrastructure setup (accounts, domains, APIs, etc.)
		   - What I must configure before coding
		   - Credentials/keys I need to obtain
		   - Cost breakdown (free tiers, paid services)
		   - Pre-development checklist
		   - Estimated time for each task
		
		1. BROWSER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
		   - Session-by-session build plan optimized for Claude.ai chat
		   - Each session = 1-3 hours of focused work
		   - Clear "I'm ready for Session X" prompts I can use
		   - Designed for copy/paste workflow
		   - Include testing steps after each session
		   - Git commit strategy
		   - Troubleshooting support approach
		   - Timeline estimate (weeks)
		
		CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
		- All documents must assume I'm using Claude.ai browser interface (no API costs)
		- Provide COMPLETE code (no truncation or "rest of file here")
		- Clear file paths for every piece of code
		- Prioritize features into phases (MVP first)
		- Be specific about what I do manually vs. what we build together
		- Include cost estimates for any paid services
		
		BEFORE GENERATING DOCUMENTS:
		Ask me clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME (Socratic method) to fill any gaps in:
		- Technical requirements or constraints
		- Timeline and launch goals
		- Budget limitations
		- Existing content/assets
		- Tool preferences or restrictions
		- Specific uncertainties in my project plan
		
		Once you have all the information, generate the three documents as artifacts.
